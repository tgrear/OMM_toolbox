# OMM_tools

Computational tools for running and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) using OpenMM and Pymol. For citation purposes, refer to (https://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/publications) for OpenMM and (https://pymol.org/support.html#citing) for Pymol. This repository contains:

1) Lysozyme in water MDS demo. The OpenMM documentation for the lysozyme tutorial can be found here:

   The original GROMACS version can be found here: http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/01_pdb2gmx.html.
   Both provide additional information for the steps executed in the tutorial pipeline.

2) A general platform for OpenMM MDS workflows and analysis [UNDER CONSTRUCTION].

4) Example OpenMM workflow implementing AToM for free energy approximation [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]. Additional information can be found here: https://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/atom-openmm/the-science-behind-atom.
