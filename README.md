# OMM_tools

Computational tools for running and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) using OpenMM and Pymol. This repository contains:

1) Lysozyme in water MDS. The OpenMM documentation for the lysozyme tutorial can be found here:
   https://openmm.github.io/openmm-cookbook/latest/notebooks/tutorials/protein_in_water.html.
   The original GROMACS version can be found here: http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/01_pdb2gmx.html.
   Both provide additional information on the steps executed in the tutorial pipeline.

3) A general platform for MDS workflows and analysis.
4) Example workflow implementing AToM for free energy approximation.
